# Word-cloud-builder
 
This project focuses on implementing an R Shiny app for creating word clouds from text files. The app will give users an opportunity to upload a text file, then the it will generate a word cloud automatically. This app will be beneficial for text mining projects whereby users do not need to write code for generating word clouds. I am implementing this project with the guidance of Dr. Adrian who is an Associate Professor at Grand Valley State University.
