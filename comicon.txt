A stormtrooper, a Spider-Man, and a Harley Quinn walk into a  bar … which means it must be Comic-Con season.

The popularity of comic conventions, particularly San Diego’s, has skyrocketed since their inception in 1970. Comic-Cons offer a way to unify people of all walks of life in their shared interests of comic books, anime, film, science fiction and fantasy genres, and so much more. Throughout these conventions, fans can meet with other fans, cosplay, meet celebrities, and attend panels — you know, just like Simpleview Summit!

 
Impact
These conventions present an opportunity for local hospitality sectors to cater to these growing fan bases, generating significant revenue. Though the attendees greatly benefit from the panels, vendors, and camaraderie, Comic conventions are a boon in economic expansion for local tourism industries.

Over $700 million in state and local tax revenue.
